======

Project to take a site developed in django and make it usable by others with a minimum of effort.

Dependancies
------------

Development has been taking place on Python 2.7 and Django 1.4, but it should
work with previous versions.

The following python modules are required:

  - PIL
  - pyexiv2

Installation
------------

In an attempt to make this easier to install, simply run 

./install/configure.py

Answer the questions and it will create the files ready for use. You will
still need to setup the webserver to service the files, but the django portion
of the install will have been completed.
